 if the bean is not fully initialized yet, for example because it is involved
 in a circular reference.

 <p>Note: A circular reference with a FactoryBean cannot be solved by eagerly
 caching singleton instances like with normal beans. The reason is that
 <i>every</i> FactoryBean needs to be fully initialized before it can
 return the created bean, while only <i>specific</i> normal beans need
 to be initialized - that is, if a collaborating bean actually invokes
 them on initialization instead of just storing the reference.]]></ProblemDetailHtml><SolutionDetailHtml><![CDATA[Common solutions for this exception have not yet been submitted.]]></SolutionDetailHtml><AdditionalResourcesDetailHtml></AdditionalResourcesDetailHtml></RuntimeErrorAnalysis>
